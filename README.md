# smart-contract-car-sale
In this smart contract, the car seller deploys the contract by providing the car model and the sale price. The contract has a purchaseCar() function which allows a buyer to purchase the car by sending the required amount of Ether (or any other supported cryptocurrency). The buyer becomes the new owner of the car, and the contract's state is updated to reflect that the car has been sold.

The contract also includes a withdrawFunds() function which allows the seller to withdraw the contract's balance once the car is sold. The getContractBalance() function allows the seller to check the current balance of the contract.

Please note that this is a basic implementation and may require additional features depending on your specific requirements. Also, ensure that you thoroughly test and secure your smart contract before deploying it to a live blockchain network.
